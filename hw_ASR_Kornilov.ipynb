              "\"You. Ike was born on Christmas Day in 1642. England's Bonnie Lincolnshire is where that child grew. At 18, he went off to be at Cambridge University. His passion there for mathematics grew in years before the calculus priority dispute. Now, Will was born in Germany when Ike was only three. By 16 he had earned a university degree in law. He earned an LLD, then worked a while in alchemy. But math was not a path that he pursued. In years before the calculus priority dispute, Cambridge halls were closed by plague in 1665, so Ike returned to Lincolnshire with fresh and fertile mind. For two years he worked avidly on calculus and gravity. But of his thoughts he published just a few a fault that bond the calculus priority dispute Isaac shared his opus with his Cambridge teacher friend, who sent it to another to show what his pupil penned. When Willie met this second guy. Ike's manuscripted pspy, the notes he took would tarnish his repute and further fueled the calculus priority dispute. The learned british army pledged allegiance to their man, while Willie earned support from other nations in the land, and butt was flung by either side, defending I for Willie's pride as Europe's academic battle crude the continental capitalist priority dispute. Responding to suggestions that Wilt's honor was corrupt, he asked the Royal Society to clear the matter up. That jury was presided by none other than that Newton guy. The deference of the group was absolute, which added to the calculus priority dispute. Now Willie spent his final years just trying to clear his name, emotionally damaged from this vengeful, bitter game. I don't know if he laughed or cried when Isaac heard his buddy died, but certainly it gave him an acute advantage in the calculus priority dispute. The scoreboard on this battlefield, with centuries traversed, says Will, worked independently. But Isaac got there first, though Willie clearly takes the prize for symbol ism he devised. When all the points are tallied, most conclude two winners in the calculus priority dispute. When all the points are tallied, most conclude two winners in the calculus priority dispute. Close.\""
